# About Me

I am **Muxin Zhou (周慕歆)**, a first-year Ph.D. student at the **Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)**, majoring in **Robotics**.  
I am honored to be advised by **Professor Dezhen Song** — our lab website can be found [here](https://ix0tuaezs81enc3q4po8va.on.drv.tw/www.networked-robot.online/).

My research interests include **robotic tactile perception**, **diffusion policy**, **embodied AI**, **robotic language navigation**, **4D tracking**, and **human video learning**.  
I am passionate about developing robots that can perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world intelligently.
